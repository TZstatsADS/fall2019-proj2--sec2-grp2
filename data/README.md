# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Data folder

Since the original data we choose is too big, we cannot upload it on the github. Here is the URL of the data [NYPD Complaint Data Historic](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i). Also, we further processed the original data into the data we actually used in this project, and we put it in the output file, named data2018.
